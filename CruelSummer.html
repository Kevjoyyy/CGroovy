    <span>(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)</span><br />
    <span>Fever dream high in the quiet of the night</span><br />
    <span>You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)</span><br />
    <span>Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price</span><br />
    <span>You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)</span><br />
    <span>Killing me slow, out the window</span><br />
    <span>I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below</span><br />
    <span>Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes</span><br />
    <span>What doesn't kill me makes me want you more</span><br />
    <span>And it's new, the shape of your body</span><br />
    <span>It's blue, the feeling I've got</span><br />
    <span>And it's ooh, woah-oh</span><br />
    <span>It's a cruel summer</span><br />
    <span>It's cool, that's what I tell 'em</span><br />
    <span>No rules in breakable heaven</span><br />
    <span>But ooh, woah-oh</span><br />
    <span>It's a cruel summer with you</span><br />
    <span>Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine</span><br />
    <span>I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)</span><br />
    <span>We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times</span><br />
    <span>We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)</span><br />
    <span>So cut the headlights, summer's a knifeSo cut the headlights, summer's a knife</span><br />
    <span>I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone<span><br />
    <span>Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes</span><br />
    <span>And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know, oh</span><br />
    <span>It's new, the shape of your body</span><br />
    <span>It's blue, the feeling I've got</span><br />

    <span>And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)</span><br />
    <span>Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true</span><br />
    <span>I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you</span><br />
    <span>And I snuck in through the garden gate</span><br />
    <span>Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)</span><br />
    <span>And I scream, "For whatever it's worth</span><br />
    <span>I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"</span><br />
    <span>He looks up, grinnin' like a devil</span><br />
