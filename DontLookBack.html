    <span>Slip inside the eye of your mind</span><br />
    <span>Don't you know you might find</span><br />
    <span>A better place to play?</span><br />
    <span>You said that you'd never been</span><br />
    <span>But all the things that you've seen</span><br />
    <span>Will slowly fade away</span><br />
    <span>So I start a revolution from my bed</span><br />
    <span>'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head</span><br />
    <span>Step outside, summertime's in bloom</span><br />
    <span>Stand up beside the fireplace</span><br />
    <span>Take that look from off your face</span><br />
    <span>You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out</span><br />
    <span>And so, Sally can wait</span><br />
    <span>She knows it's too late as we're walkin' on by</span><br />
    <span>Her soul slides away</span><br />
    <span>"But don't look back in anger," I heard you say</span><br />
    <span>Take me to the place where you go</span><br />
    <span>Where nobody knows</span><br />
    <span>If it's night or day</span><br />
    <span>Please don't put your life in the hands</span><br />
    <span>Of a rock 'n' roll band</span><br />
    <span>Who'll throw it all away</span><br />
    <span>I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed<span><br />
    <span>'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head</span><br />
    <span>Step outside, 'cause summertime's in bloom</span><br />
    <span>Stand up beside the fireplace</span><br />
    <span>Take that look from off your face</span><br />
    <span>'Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out</span><br />
    <span>And so, Sally can wait</span><br />
