    <span>(But I wanna stay)</span><br />
    <span>I want you to stay</span><br />
    <span>'Til I'm in the grave</span><br />
    <span>'Til I rot away, dead and buried</span><br />
    <span>'Til I'm in the casket you carry</span><br />
    <span>If you go, I'm goin' too, uh</span><br />
    <span>'Cause it was always you (Alright)</span><br />
    <span>And if I'm turnin' blue, please don't save me</span><br />
    <span>Nothin' left to lose without my baby</span><br />
    <span>Birds of a feather, we should stick together, I know</span><br />
    <span>I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone</span><br />
    <span>Can't change the weather, might not be forever</span><br />
    <span>But if it's forever, it's even better</span><br />
    <span>And I don't know what I'm cryin' for</span><br />
    <span>I don't think I could love you more</span><br />
    <span>It might not be long, but baby, I</span><br />
    <span>I'll love you 'til the day that I die</span><br />
    <span>'Til the day that I die</span><br />
    <span>'Til the light leaves my eyes</span><br />
    <span>'Til the day that I die</span><br />
    <span>I want you to see, hm</span><br />
    <span>How you look to me, hm</span><br />
    <span>You wouldn't believe if I told ya</span><br />
    <span>You would keep the compliments I throw ya</span><br />
    <span>But you're so full of shit, uh</span><br />
    <span>Tell me it's a bit, oh</span><br />
    <span>Say you don't see it, your mind's polluted</span><br />
    <span>Say you wanna quit, don't be stupid</span><br />
    <span>And I don't know what I'm cryin' for</span><br />
    <span>I don't think I could love you more</span><br />
    <span>It might not be long, but baby, I</span><br />
    <span>Don't wanna say goodbye</span><br />
    <span>Birds of a feather, we should stick together, I know ('Til the day that I die)</span><br />
    <span>I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone ('Til the light leaves my eyes)</span><br />
    <span>Can't change the weather, might not be forever ('Til the day that I die)</span><br />
    <span>But if it's forever, it's even better</span><br />
    <span>I knew you in another life</span><br />
    <span>You had that same look in your eyes</span><br />
    <span>I love you, don't act so surprised</span><br />
