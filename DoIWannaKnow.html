    <span>Have you got colour in your cheeks?</span><br />
    <span>Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type</span><br />
    <span>That sticks around like summat in your teeth?</span><br />
    <span>Are there some aces up your sleeve?</span><br />
    <span>Have you no idea that you're in deep?</span><br />
    <span>I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week</span><br />
    <span>How many secrets can you keep?</span><br />
    <span>'Cause there's this tune I found</span><br />
    <span>That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat</span><br />
    <span>Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee</span><br />
    <span>(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?</span><br />
    <span>(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay</span><br />
    <span>(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made</span><br />
    <span>For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day</span><br />
    <span>Crawlin' back to you</span><br />
    <span>Ever thought of callin' when</span><br />
    <span>You've had a few?</span><br />
    <span>'Cause I always do</span><br />
    <span>Maybe I'm too</span><br />
    <span>Busy bein' yours</span><br />
    <span>To fall for somebody new</span><br />
    <span>Now, I've thought it through</span><br />
    <span>Crawlin' back to you<span><br />
    <span>So have you got the guts?</span><br />
    <span>Been wonderin' if your heart's still open</span><br />
    <span>And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts</span><br />
    <span>Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt</span><br />
    <span>It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you</span><br />
    <span>But I don't know if you feel the same as I do</span><br />
    <span>But we could be together if you wanted to</span><br />
    <span>(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?</span><br />
    <span>(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay</span><br />
    <span>(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made</span><br />
    <span>For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day</span><br />
    <span>Crawlin' back to you (Crawlin' back to you)</span><br />
    <span>Ever thought of callin' when</span><br />
    <span>You've had a few? (You've had a few)</span><br />
    <span>'Cause I always do ('Cause I always do)</span><br />
    <span>Maybe I'm too (Maybe I'm too busy)</span><br />
    <span>Busy bein' yours (Bein' yours)</span><br />
    <span>To fall for somebody new</span><br />
    <span>Now, I've thought it through</span><br />
